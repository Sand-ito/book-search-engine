# book-search-engine

Hi! My name is Josh. Welcome to my book search app. 

[Here is a link to my deployed website, check it out!](https://desolate-escarpment-61600.herokuapp.com/)


There was a lot of challenges here to get the final product. But the main goal here was to refactor the code! Some things that were refactored was to change the code to implement in Apollo Server. With that came some additions in the server side like the `schemas` directory, as well as mutations and queries in the `utils` directory in the client side.

I learned a lot from this project espcally debugging I had problems ranging from simple syntax errors to fixing my npm package as the day we were assigned this project, `apollo/client` got a new version that did not like to communicate with another large component. This was a great learning expericance!

Thank you for taking your time to look at my code and giving feed back. Have a nice day!
